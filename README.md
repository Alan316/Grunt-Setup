# Grunt-Setup
Sample Grunt Setup for simple tasks.

This grunt configuration was made following Matt Bailey's Beginners Guide to Grunt.
http://mattbailey.io/a-beginners-guide-to-grunt-redux/

It will optimize images, compile sass, compile pug, and validate and make your javascripts ugly, and serves as a task watcher. Place all working files in the following directory structure:
<br>src/images
<br>src/scripts
<br>src/styles
<br>src/Pug

Clean currently is set to not delete /dist directory upon start. It's not efficient to start from scratch everytime grunt isn't run as standalone. 


Changelog -
------------
Version 0.2.0 - Updated Dependency versions and added Pug file compilations

Version 0.3.0 - Updated Dependencies (Long Overdue)
